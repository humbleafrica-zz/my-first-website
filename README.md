This is my first git hub project

Welcome!

I have been interested in IT for a very long part of my life. I have mostly worked in hardware and temper with software when I can.

I took an interest in coding but I graduated a data scientist.

This is my first gib hub coding experience.

I'll be using javascript, python, flask, mongo db and a few others in git and github  to create this page and future pages
